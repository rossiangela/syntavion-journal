abstract: "This project presents a machine learning system for diagnosing Parkinson's\
  \ disease \nthrough voice analysis using Random Forest classification. The model\
  \ achieved 92% \noverall accuracy and 97% recall for Parkinson's patients, with\
  \ an AUC-ROC of 0.96. \nThe trained model was successfully converted to TensorFlow\
  \ Lite for deployment on \nmobile devices and embedded systems, enabling real-time\
  \ diagnostic support in \nclinical settings. The system analyzes 22 voice features\
  \ including jitter, shimmer, \nand harmonic-to-noise ratios to distinguish between\
  \ healthy individuals and those \nwith Parkinson's disease.\n"
