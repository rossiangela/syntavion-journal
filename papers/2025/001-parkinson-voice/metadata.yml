abstract: |
  This project presents a machine learning system for diagnosing Parkinson's disease 
  through voice analysis using Random Forest classification. The model achieved 92% 
  overall accuracy and 97% recall for Parkinson's patients, with an AUC-ROC of 0.96. 
  The trained model was successfully converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on 
  mobile devices and embedded systems, enabling real-time diagnostic support in 
  clinical settings. The system analyzes 22 voice features including jitter, shimmer, 
  and harmonic-to-noise ratios to distinguish between healthy individuals and those 
  with Parkinson's disease.
